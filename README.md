# Data-Visualization

Hi,

This is the project that spans Chapters 15, 16 and 17 from the book: Python Crash Course, A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes.

The objective here was to code along and understand/study as well as develop my knowledge in Data Science and its modules in Python. 

I plan to enroll in either Data Science or Financial Analyzis in my career which means that these lessons are of extreme importance to me.

Cheers,

Tiago
